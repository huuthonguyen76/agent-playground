- Energetic: Things move fast around here, and we're always looking ahead to deliver products that people use intuitively as part of their working life. It takes energy and commitment; we're an agile business that's fully focused on delivering outcomes with a total commitment to quality and reliability. We don't rush or cut corners, we work as a team and channel our energy in the right direction.
- Innovative: Innovation drives us. We don't compromise on ideas, and we always innovate with purpose, encouraging the right decisions to be made for the right reasons, to take us forward. We listen to our workmates and our customers, we're not closed off, monotonous or stale. We're competing for talent with some of the world's biggest technology businesses, so our employer brand language reflects the modern world we live in, attracting those we need with warm, welcoming language, clearly and confidently highlighting what people can  expect here, without resorting to jargon or exaggeration. 
- Assured: We're assured, confident about the future and the part we have to play in it. But we're not unrealistic, arrogant, or assuming; we take time to explore and ask questions, we don't carry on regardless. We're calm and in control. We're sure of our skills and our ability to deliver, we trust and rely on one another, and we're confident in our direction. Our employer brand messaging reflects our assuredness and ability to make a difference in the world.
- Authentic: We're the good people. We operate with integrity, and while we are in business to make a profit, we don't put profits before people or the planet. We encourage honesty and transparency, and we believe that good people and innovative thinking is the way to win. Our culture and our people are authentic â€“ they reflect each other and grow together.
